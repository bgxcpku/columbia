This latex template includes all major pieces (in bold below) typically
required for an NSF proposal.  The idea is that the PIs create one PDF
document, from which each piece can be extracted and uploaded to FastLane.
I have structured it as a two-PI proposal, to make things easy in case
(for example) each PI wishes to write a separate technical section or 
bring a separate \verb+.bib+ file to the bibliography.

You can retrieve this template from any CSAIL machine with the following
command (all on one line):
\begin{verbatim}
svn checkout
svn+ssh://svn.csail.mit.edu/afs/csail.mit.edu/group/rvsn/funding/NSF/template
\end{verbatim}

Using this template might save both you and CSAIL HQ staff some work
next time you put in an NSF proposal.
