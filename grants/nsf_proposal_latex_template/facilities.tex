All work will be performed within the MIT Computer Science and
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).  CSAIL is equipped with a
large number of individual workstations, running a variety of operating
systems, all interconnected on wireless and wired networks.  Most
machines use AFS for file storage; the CSAIL administrators provide an
SVN server for source control of multiple source trees.

This project will have access to specific MIT CSAIL facilities,
including:
\begin{itemize}

\item Robotics laboratory

\item Hardware lab

\item System administrators

\item Machine shop

\item Gigabit Ethernet

\item Several Tb of AFS storage with daily backup

\end{itemize}

CSAIL also maintains extensive mechanical and electrical prototyping
facilities, allowing rapid system construction. A complete machine shop
and sheet metal prototype fabrication facility is available, along with
stocks of small electrical components, connectors, wire, etc. All of
this enables us to make quick mock-ups of proposed designs.  The
Laboratory provides an environment of excellent students interested 
in advanced systems, networking HCI and software technologies,
knowledge-representation, reasoning, planning, decision-theoretic
techniques, and inference.
