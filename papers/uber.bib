	models to perform density estimation and clustering. However, when
	the data available have a distribution evolving over time, such models
	are inadequate. We introduce here a class of time-varying DPMs which
	ensures that at each time step the random distribution follows a
	DPM model. Our model relies on an intuitive and simple generalized
	Polya urn scheme. Inference is performed using Markov chain Monte
	Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo. We demonstrate our model on various
