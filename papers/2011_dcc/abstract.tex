\subsection*{Abstract}

We present a general-purpose, lossless compressor for {\em streaming} data.  This compressor is based on a probabilistic, general-purpose, lossless compressor for {\em batch} data called deplump.  We both introduce a new approximation and combine for the first time two existing approximations to inference in the probabilistic model underlying deplump that together yield the computational asymptotics for inference required by a general-purpose, probabilistic, lossless streaming compressor.  We leave the name of the resulting streaming compressor the same, deplump, and demonstrate its performance on large text corpora.
