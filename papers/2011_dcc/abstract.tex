\subsection*{Abstract}

We present a general-purpose, lossless compressor for {\em streaming} data.  This compressor is based on a probabilistic, general-purpose, lossless compressor for {\em batch} data called deplump.  We both introduce a new approximation to inference in the probabilistic model underlying deplump and combine for the first time two existing approximations that together yield the computational asymptotics for inference required for streaming compresion.  We leave the name of the resulting streaming compressor the same, deplump, and demonstrate its performance on large text corpora.
