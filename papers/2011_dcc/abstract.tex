\subsection*{Abstract}

We present a general-purpose, lossless compressor for {\em streaming} data.  This compressor is based on a probabilistic, general-purpose, lossless compressor for {\em batch} data called deplump.  To make deplump stream-capable we introduce a new approximation for inference in the underlying probabilistic model.  Combined with existing inference techniques the new approximation yields an algorithm with the computational asymptotics required for streaming compresion.  We demonstrate the performance of this streaming deplump variant on large text corpora.
