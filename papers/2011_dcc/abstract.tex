\subsection*{Abstract}

We present a general-purpose, lossless compressor for  streaming data.  This compressor is based on the deplump probabilistic compressor for batch data.  Approximations to the inference procedure used in the probabilistic model underpinning deplump are introduced to yield the computational asyptotics necessary for stream compression. We demonstrate the performance of this streaming deplump variant relative to the batch compressor on a benchmark corpus and find that it performs equivalently well despite these approximations.  We also explore the performance of the streaming variant on corpora that are too large to be compressed by batch deplump and demonstrate excellent compression performance.

%In order to make deplump stream-capable%To make deplump stream-capable we introduce a new approximation for inference in the underlying probabilistic model.  Combined with existing inference techniques the new approximation yields an algorithm with the computational asymptotics required for streaming compresion.  We demonstrate the performance of this streaming deplump variant on large text corpora.
