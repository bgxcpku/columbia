\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

As the performance of batch deplump was established relative to other lossless compressors for a variety of datatypes in \citep{Gasthaus2010}, we focus our experiments on establishing a) that the approximations to inference in the sequence memoizer combined in this paper in order to make deplump a streaming compressor do not significantly adversely affect compression performance, b) that the resulting compressor can indeed compress extremely long sequences as the asymptotic guarantees would suggest it should, and c) which settings of the approximation parameters produce the best compression performance.

Almost all of the experiments included in this paper use a complete Wikipedia text content dump \citep{Wikipedia2010} as a test corpus (26.8Gb uncompressed, 7.8Gb gziped and ??Gb paq9a'ed, each with default parameters, and 3.9Gb deplumped).  

To establish what approximation parameters produce the best compression results we first ran streaming deplump on the first 100Mb section of the corpus limiting the depth to two different values ($D=16$ and $D=1024$) with a fixed limit on the number of nodes in the tree ($L=10^6$).  We observed that in both cases only very few nodes had high total counts ($c > 8,192$) suggesting that it might be possible to set the count upper bound conservatively ($k= 8,192$) without significant compression performance degradation.  %That compression performance should not be affected by a reasonable count bound follows intuitively from the fact that in byte sequences $|\Sigma| = 256$ and setting $k=10,000$ is similar in effect to using 10,000 observations to estimate a 256 element discrete distribution.  
To ensure that compression performance did in fact not suffer, we compressed ten 100Mb subsections of the corpus (sampled randomly with replacement) for multiple values of $k$ between 128 and 32,768 (fixing $L=10^6$ and $D=16$).  We observed that average compression performance indeed varied insignificantly over all values of $k$.

  In the next experiment, the interplay between limiting the number of nodes in the tree and restricting the depth of the tree was explored (results for which are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:varying_depths}).  Here $k$ was set to 8,192, while $L$ and the depth of the tree $D$ were varied as indicated in the figure.  In another experiment, the interplay between stream length and node limit was explored (Figure~\ref{fig:varying_stream_length}).  In this experiment $k$ remained fixed at the same value and the depth was set to $D=16$ while $L$ varied as shown in the figure.  
 In both experiments, subsections of the corpus were sampled with replacement.  In the first experiment the sampled subsections were all of size 100Mb, while in the second the sampled subsections varied in length.

Figure~\ref{fig:varying_depths} indicates that compression performance becomes essentially indistinguishable for depth restrictions greater than $D=10$.  However, this figure also suggests that compression performance almost improves as a function of the number of nodes in the tree for depths 6 and greater.  Figure~\ref{fig:varying_stream_length} illustrates that the algorithm not only scales to very long sequences, but average compression performance continues to improve as the sequence grows.  Using a large value of $L$ appears to be beneficial for very long sequences.

Considering these results, we chose values for the approximating parameters ($D=32$, $L=10^7$, $k=8,192$, $T=10^8$, $\mathcal{D} = [.5, .7, .8, .82, .84, .88, .91, .92, .93, .94, .95, .93]$, and $\eta=0.0001$) then compared streaming deplump to to batch deplump.  In this experiment we achieved compression performance of 1.67 bites per byte on the 100Mb Wikipedia corpus excerpt used for the Hutter Prize \citep{Hutter2006} using the streaming variant of deplump.  Using batch deplump \citep{Gasthaus2010} achieve 1.66 bits per byte.  If we use batch deplump to compress the corpus in 5Mb subsections the performance falls to 1.88 bits per byte. These results demonstrate that the approximations made for streaming deplump give it a significant advantage over compressing the file in chunks and have very little negative effect when compared to the full model.
