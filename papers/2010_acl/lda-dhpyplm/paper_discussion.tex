We have presented here an integrated topic-language model based on hierarchical nonparametric Bayesian inference.  It performs competitively with other integrated topic-language models, and superiorly for small numbers of topics.  Future direction for work includes testing on larger corpuses, making direct comparison with equivalent methods easier, and examining the topic distributions extracted.  We are most excited by the prospect that meaningful two- and three-word phrases may be extracted for each topic by examining the most likely two- and three-word combinations of each topic-specific language model.
