\begin{abstract}
In this work we describe a novel, multi-domain, smoothing $n$-gram language model in which every word is associated with a latent indicator variable that indicates the domain from which it was generated.  Given the domain for each word, a document is modeled as a sequence of draws from smoothed conditional probability tables indexed by both the observed context history and the latent domain.   We develop a generative description and derive a Bayesian inference procedure for this model and show improved language modeling results in terms of perplexity.
