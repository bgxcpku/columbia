\begin{itemize}
\item What if you add vars with largest contribution first. Best variables by forward selection could be masked. For example if we add first best then adding next two best variables one-by-one can produce worse results than finding two best at the same time.

\item When adding new best variable optimal $\tau$ can change. What is the best tau as a function of the number of parameters. Probably will be different for L1 and L2. It is decreasing as function of parameters, probably $1/n$ or $1/\sqrt{n}$

\end{itemize}
