In the course of this work we have shown one way to develop a dependent HPYP.  We believe it to be the case that there will emerge other ways to construct dependent HPYP's.  The dependency in our specific HPYP formulation arises from deleting restaurants in a Chinese restaurant franchise representation.  We demonstrate that this restaurant deletion scheme may either be deterministic or probabilistic.  In contrast to others who have used deletion to induce dependency Because of this it is possible to build constant memory sequential inference procedures for our model.  We have not yet explored batch inference procedures for our model, though doing so would give us an indication of how much of a penalty we pay for the approximate sequential inference approach we use.  The utility of our predictive model when embedded in a lossless compressor seems promising.

That the constant memory model variants perform well is not as surprising as it might seem, even in light the extreme inference scheme
