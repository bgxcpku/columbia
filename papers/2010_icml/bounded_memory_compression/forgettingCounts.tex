% Use the following line _only_ if you're still using LaTeX 2.09.
%\documentstyle[icml2010,epsf,natbib]{article}
% If you rely on Latex2e packages, like most moden people use this:
\documentclass{article}

% For figures
\usepackage{graphicx} % more modern
%\usepackage{epsfig} % less modern
\usepackage{subfigure} 

% For citations
\usepackage{natbib}

% For algorithms
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algorithmic}

% As of 2010, we use the hyperref package to produce hyperlinks in the
% resulting PDF.  If this breaks your system, please commend out the
% following usepackage line and replace \usepackage{icml2010} with
% \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2010} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Packages hyperref and algorithmic misbehave sometimes.  We can fix
% this with the following command.
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Employ the following version of the ``usepackage'' statement for
% submitting the draft version of the paper for review.  This will set
% the note in the first column to ``Under review.  Do not distribute.''
\usepackage{icml2010} 

% Employ this version of the ``usepackage'' statement after the paper has
% been accepted, when creating the final version.  This will set the
% note in the first column to ``Appearing in''
% \usepackage[accepted]{icml2010}

\newcommand{\F}{\mathcal{F}}
\newcommand{\PY}{\mathcal{P}\mathcal{Y}}
\newcommand{\G}{\mathcal{G}}
\newcommand{\ES}{\mathcal{E}\mathcal{S}}
\newcommand{\DP}{\mathcal{D}\mathcal{P}}

% The \icmltitle you define below is probably too long as a header.

% It is OKAY to include author information, even for blind

% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the icml2010
% package.
