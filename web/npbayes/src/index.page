The NP Bayes reading group is a reading group lead by [Professor Wood] in the [Statistics Department] at Columbia university.  We meet weekly to discuss topics in machine learning and statistics, with a focus on the theory and practice of nonparametric Bayesian inference. The group meets from 1-2 pm on Thursday in room 1025 in the School of Social Work.  If you are interested in joining, please contact either Professor Wood or [David Pfau] or check out our [Google Group].
