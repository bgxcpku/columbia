The [Sequence Memoizer](papers/index.html) is a nonparametric Bayesian model for discrete sequence modeling.  Sequence modeling is useful for tasks such as natural language processing and [compression](http://deplump.com/).  This website has been established to share implementations of the model and encourage further development.

This website is to be a platform for discussing the sequence memoizer and other nonparameteric Bayesian methods.  If you are doing research related to the Sequence Memoizer or just want to be informed regarding the ongoing discussion, please sign up for the [sequence memoizer google group](http://groups.google.com/group/sequence-memoizer?hl=en).
