## R + Java + Sequence Memoizer
It is possible to use the Java versions of the sequence memoizer in R.  

[Daniel Lee](mailto:bearlee@alum.mit.edu) has developed two different approaches to using the sequence memoizer in R.

### R Package

<a href = "SequenceMemoizer_1.0.0.tar.gz" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/downloads/sm_r_package_v1'); ">SequenceMemoizer_1.0.0.tar.gz</a>

### Using rJava (first integration)

"I've ported the example that's in the Matlab section to R. This was
done without an R friendly wrapper. I figured you might as well throw
this up to demonstrate how easy it is to get it up and running now. It
is assumed that the [jar](../jar_file/index.html) is placed in the working directory of R (which
can be found by calling getwd()) and rJava is installed
(install.packages ("rJava")). There is no "import" functionality in
rJava, so I've had to construct the objects using the fully qualified
names. Other than that, it's mostly a line by line translation of the
Matlab example."

### R sequence memoizer usage (java, simple) 

[Example-withoutPackage.R](Example-withoutPackage.R)

We are looking for a collaborator to help develop an R package importing the current jar files into R.
