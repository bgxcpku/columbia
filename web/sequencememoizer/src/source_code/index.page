## Git Repository

The source code is available in a public Git repository. To access the repository you will need to have [Git installed] on your computer.  After you have installed Git you need to [set up an SSH key pair and added it to your GitHub account].

Once Git has been installed and you have a SSH key pair, you will need to register a username with Git.  You can do this by calling the following from the terminal (once you add /usr/local/git/bin to your path)

<b>git config --global user.name "Your Name"<br/>
git config --global user.email your.email@whatever.com</b>

Once you have registered, create a directory where you wish to house the Git repository calling in your terminal 

<b>mkdir public_sequence_memoizer</b>

or some other name you prefer. Then call

<b>cd public_sequence_memoizer<br/>
git init<br/>
git remote add origin git@github.com:nbartlett/Sequence-Memoizer.git<br/>
git pull origin master</b>

If you make changes to source files which you wish to push back to the repository then call 

<b>git add files_you_changed<br/>
git commit -m 'a short message about what you changed'<br/>
git push</b>

If changes are made by other people you can update your local repository by calling

<b>git pull origin master</b>

## Maven

Since the code was developed by combining multiple projects, we use Maven to compile the code.  Maven makes managing dependencies especially easy. To compile the source code you will need to have Maven installed on your computer.  If you do not, you can [download Maven] and follow the installation instructions halfway down the page.

## Code

Now that you have the code on your machine and Maven ready to go you need to add the trove jar to the Maven repository.  You can do this by navigating into the Trove project folder inside the publc Git repository and typing in the termail window

<b>mvn install:install-file<br/>
-Dfile=trove-3.0.0a3.jar<br/>
-DgroupId=gnu<br/> 
-DartifactId=trove<br/> 
-Dversion = 3.0.0a3<br/> 
-Dpackaging=jar<br/> 
-DgeneratePom=true</b>

all on one line.  Finally, you are ready to actually use and compile the source code.  You can open the projects <b>Public Sequence Memoizer</b> and <b>Public Util</b> through an IDE such as [Netbeans].  You can also compile the code using the terminal by navigating to the <b>Public Util</b> project root and entering

 <b> mvn install</b>
 
 After which you should move to the  <b>Public Sequence Memoizer</b> and type the same thing.  Compiling the code must be done in sequence because of the dependencies among the projects.  When you compile the code two jars get generated, one with only the source code from the project and one with the source code from the project and all the projects on which it depends.
