## The Jar

You can downlaod the java code as a jar file.  Two versions are available, compiled with different versions of the JDK, [1.6] and [1.5]. The jar contains the [gnu.trove] package as well as the [edu.columbia.stat.wood.pub.sequencememoizer] and [edu.columbia.stat.wood.pub.util] packages.  There are no interesting main methods implemented in .jar, so all use of this code should be used either through MATLAB, instructions below, or as a java library accessed by your own project.



[1.5]: jars/v1.5/sequencememoizer-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
[1.6]: jars/v1.6/sequencememoizer-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
