Big Picture
-----------

W4240 is a master's / advanced undergraduate level course in data mining, pattern recognition, and statistical machine learning.

Rough Course Outline
--------------------

This course will be divided into roughly six parts, five structured, the sixth, a grab bag which may include presentations from other faculty and students who specialize in particular techniques.  Each section except the last will be accompanied by a programming project.  The subject of the programming project is listed below the topic for each section.

 
* Graphical Models
  * Belief propagation on discrete Bayes nets
* Sequential Data
  * Kalman and particle filtering
* Sampling
  * Gaussian mixture models and clustering
* Variational Inference
  * Variational logistic regression
* Regression
  * Bayesian linear regression, Gaussian process regression
* Miscellaneous Topics
  * Neural nets
  * Dimensionality reduction
  * Bayesian nonparametrics
  * Matrix factorization

Miscellaneous Course Information
--------------------------------

* Text 
	* _Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning_ Christopher M. Bishop.  Springer, 2006.

* Prerequisites 
	* Calculus; probability and statistics at the level of W4150, or W4105 and W4107 taken concurrently.
	* Linear algebra.
	* Introductory level programming (java, matlab, c)

* Grading 
	* Grades will be assigned on a curve, using the following percentages: 75% Homework, 25% Final Project.  Active participation can move you up a half a grade.  No participation can move you down half a grade.  


* Computing: 
	* You will be required to use Matlab to complete your homework assignments.  Software of your choice may be used to complete the final project.  See the [ACIS page](http://www.columbia.edu/acis/) for information on software and computing labs.
