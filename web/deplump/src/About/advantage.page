The difference between probabilistic lossless compressors is in the prediction engine, encoding and decoding being ["solved"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_coding) optimally already.  

Deplump compression technology is built on a probabilistic discrete sequence predictor called the [sequence memoizer](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~fwood/Papers/Wood-ICML-2009.pdf).  The sequence memoizer has been demonstrated to be a very good predictor for discrete sequences.  The advantage deplump demonstrates in comparison to other general purpose lossless compressors is largely attributable to the better guesses made by the sequence memoizer.

Deplump is algorithmically quite closely related to infinite context [prediction by partial matching (PPM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPMd) although it has differences and advantages which derive from being grounded on a coherent probabilistic predictive model.
