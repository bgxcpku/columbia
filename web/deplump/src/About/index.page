Deplump is a probabilistic lossless compression technology.  

Deplump works in the same as all probabilistic lossless compressors.  A datastream is fed one observation at a time into a predictor which emits both the data stream and predictions about what the next observation in the stream should be for every observation.  An encoder takes this output and produces a compressed stream which can be piped over a network or to a file.  A receiver then takes this stream and decompresses it by doing everything in reverse.  In order to ensure that the decoder has the same information available to it that the encoder had when compressing the stream, the decoded datastream is both emitted and directed to another predictor.  This second predictor's job is to produce exactly the same predictions as the initial predictor so that the decoder has the same information at every step of the process as the encoder did.
