## Welcome to the future of streaming lossless compression.

Experience deplump general purpose lossless compression right now (2Mb limit):  
______________________
To *deplump* (compress) a file use:

<form action="DeplumpServlet" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
<input type="file" name="datafile" size="40"></input>
<input type="submit" value="Deplump"></input>
</form>

<p></p>
To *plump* (decompress) a previously deplumped file use:
<form action="PlumpServlet" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
<input type="file" name="datafile" size="40"></input>
<input type="submit" value="Plump"></input>
</form>

To make comparing deplump to other compressors easier for you we're <a href="LookupStatistics">keeping track</a> of how we're doing on the data compressed using this form.  <a href="LookupStatistics">Check out the results</a> and [send us your thoughts](mailto:feedback@deplump.com).

####Important Disclaimers
_____________________
- *Any data you send us using this form will be sent back and forth to our server in the clear and is therefore vulnerable to intercept.  Don't deplump sensitive data.*
- *Absolutely do not discard your original data.  Deplump is alpha code undergoing constant development.  There is a very high chance that tomorrow's version of deplump will be incompatible with today's.  This means you might not ever be able to recover your original data if you were silly enough to discard it after this warning.  That would be miserable for all of us, so treat this as it is; an easy way to try out an awesome new lossless compression technology.*
