Deplump compression technology is currently being spun-out of the [Wood](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~fwood) statistics laboratory at [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu/).  

We are actively seeking commercial partnerships (licensing, research, etc.).  Example licensing and research opportunities include:

- Streaming data compression for telco backbone bandwidth expansion.
- Embedded packet compression for bandwidth restricted devices such as mobile phones, plc's, satellites, etc.
- Internet content distribution, client to server communication compression, data warehousing soft expansion, etc.

Parties interested in:

- licensing information send email to [licensing@deplump.com](mailto:licensing@deplump.com)
- all other requests send email to [info@deplump.com](mailto:info@deplump.com)
- reporting problems with the website or the deplump demonstration send email to [problem@deplump.com](mailto:problem@deplump.com)
