## General Purpose Lossless Compression

Go to [deplump.com](http://www.deplump.com/) to see the latest in lossless compression technology.  The sequence prediction technology behind this is the subject of current research taking place in my group and others.  We are currently looking for industrial partners to license the technology. 

## Computational Tools for the Sports Gambling Industry

What are the fair odds for a bet on a soccer or tennis match in running?  Moreover, given a statistical model of how a game evolves, can one efficiently compute what such a fair price should be? And for all kinds of different outcomes?

The answer to the first is a bit complicated.  What's fair depends on the actual game at hand, the model you devise, and many other factors.  There is no "right answer" to this problem, there are only better answers arising from more and more sophisticated statistical models.  The second is more straightforward.  Calculating "fair" odds given a model requires knowing how to do some relatively simple dynamic programming.  The links below provide examples of the kinds of tools I've helped build for sports bookmakers and other players in the sports gambling industry.  

Football (soccer) [^usage],[^trust]

: <form action="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~fwood/jnlp/football/football-odds-estimation-tool.jnlp" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post"><input type="submit" value="Launch Application"></input></form>

: Clicking the launch application button will start a java-based, automated, model-based football sports gambling market pricing demonstration tool (screenshot below, click to enlarge) that allows you to, as shown in the screenshot, enter in-game events like goals, corners, and yellow cards and then to see the effect of those in-game events on all commonly priced football gambling markets in-running.  Starting the clock will run the pricing engine in real time and prices will be updated every minute.  Simulation time can be sped up by several orders of magnitude.  Consult the footnotes if the application does not launch when you press the button.

Tennis [^tennis_usage]
: <form action="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~fwood/jnlp/tennis/tennis-pricing-prototype.jnlp" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post"><input type="submit" value="Launch Application"></input></form>  

: Clicking the launch application button will start a java-based, automated, model-based tennis sports gambling market pricing demonstration tool similar to the football tool above that allows you to enter in-game events like points and sets won and then to see the effect of those in-game events on all commonly priced tennis gambling markets in-running.  Consult the footnotes if the application does not launch when you press the button.

The technology (models, source code, historical data, etc.) behind both of these tools and more, as well as integration of these tools into online gambling markets like [Betfair](http://www.betfair.com/) belongs to the sports gambling startup Sweetech headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland.  For more information on licensing this technology for your own use, contact [Sweetech](mailto:jonas@sweetech.ch).


[^usage]: To run these applications you must have Java 6.0 or later installed on your computer.  Some problems running the applications can be resolved by going to [www.java.com](http://www.java.com/) and installing the latest JRE.  All other problems are browser specific, namely some browsers on some platforms don't support Java Web Start.  If you see XML or some other kind of weird text instead of seeing an application start, you can always use the command line on your computer to start the application by issuing the command "javaws http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~fwood/jnlp/football/football-odds-estimation-tool.jnlp" to start the football tool.  

[^tennis_usage]: To launch the tennis application from the command line use "javaws http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~fwood/jnlp/tennis/tennis-pricing-prototype.jnlp"

[^trust]: Launching either application will yield a message asking you to trust code coming from my group.  I can assure you that there is nothing malicious about either application.  They are simply nice gui-based demonstrations of how one can do efficient automatic betting market pricing given a small number of user selectable market parameters.
