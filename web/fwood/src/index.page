Dr. Wood is a statistical machine learning researcher.  His current research focus is on Bayesian nonparametric modeling. 


### New

- [Hierarchically Supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation](Papers/Perotte-2012-NIPS.pdf)

In an attempt to share with people what the scientific paper writing process is like, [J. Huggins](http://www.columbia.edu/~jhh2143/) made a [&quot;visualization&quot;](Papers/sLDA-evo.pdf) of the many versions this paper went through.  Each page is one commit.  Although the movement of the figures is the most salient feature of the visualization, taking the time to watch the text, model, and layout change is informative about the process of collaborative writing and the level of effort that goes into producing a top-flight conference paper.

### Philosophy 


Dr. Wood builds machine learning algorithms that improve on the state of the art by drawing from scientific findings at all levels of scientific investigation (physics to psychology).  He is particularly interested in pursuing the connections between specific features of Bayesian machine learning algorithms and the biological mechanisms they very much resemble.
