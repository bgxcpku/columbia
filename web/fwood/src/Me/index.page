<!-- Dr. Wood 3-unit multi-family building in the armory district of Providence's west side.  The rental units are seldomly available, but information about them (including a visual tour) is available <a href="http://members.cox.net/frank.wood/68-Dexter.html" target="_top"> here</a>.  The building is an American civil war era building and maintaining it allowed me to practice many of the skills I learned while growing up on a small farm in Illinois.-->

Dr. Wood plays many sports including <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~jjl/dingers/" target="_top">softball</a>, football, and basketball.  He runs, albeit slowly now due to chronic knee and hip injuries, and bicycles (road).  He has been known to play the trumpet and can hold a tune while singing.  Dr. Wood has traveled extensively, invents things, enjoys writing, and wishes he still had a garden.
