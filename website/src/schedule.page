The tentative schedule is 

<TABLE CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="10" border="1">
	<TR>
		<TH width = "15%">Date</TH>
		<TH width = "60%">Reading</TH>
		<TH>Group Leader</TH>
	</TR>

	<TR>
		<TD>Feb 17</TD>		
		<TD><a href = "papers/BayesAsymp.pdf">Ghosal (pages 36 - 48)</a></TD>
		<TD>Nick</TD>

		<TD><a href = "papers/BayesAsymp.pdf">Ghosal (pages 48 - ?)</a></TD>
		<TD>?</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>

The schedule is tentative and likely to change as the reading group evolves. Each session will have a group leader assigned, but this person is not responsible for creating a polished presentation of the reading material, only to help lead the group and provoke discussion.
