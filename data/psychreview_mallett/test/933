metacontrast has been the subject of # neural ? ? by n  EOL ? and by b  EOL ?  EOL the present article ? and ? on the # models ? ? not ? in the models ? and discusses the ? ?  EOL the idea ? how ? ? metacontrast functions are generated is similar in both models but the assumptions about how the visual system is organized are quite different  EOL in one of the models temporal ? combined with a complex and implausible ? hypothesis is necessary in order for masking to be obtained this model assumes a single spatial and temporal channel  EOL in the other model masking does not depend on temporal ? this model assumes multiple spatial and temporal channels and a simple ? hypothesis  EOL it is shown that of the # models only the # adequately ? empirical metacontrast functions and this model is related to recent evidence that the visual system ? multiple channels  EOL it is concluded that although it is sometimes ? as a ? and ? ? phenomenon ? from the ? of visual data and theory metacontrast may ? out to be one of the more ? ? of a multiple channel visual system  EOL
