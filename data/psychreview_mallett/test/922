EOL exp i ? a normal ? report ? in a s ? ? only ? ?  EOL exp ii used a ? ? to ? a target for this ? ?  EOL since the ? of the target was ? seen it is shown that the ? must be ? at the ? level which ?  EOL exp iii shows that the ? sensitivity for ? # ? or # ? ? is that of the rods in normal ss so that the conclusions about iconic ? in the ? ? are valid for normal ss  EOL exp ? ? the duration of the ? as a function of ? and color of the stimulus  EOL ? ? and vi ? complete and ? reports as a function of ?
