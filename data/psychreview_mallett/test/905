presents a method of analyzing reaction time rt data in recognition memory which ? an explicit model of latency ?  EOL this ? method provides a way of ? between processes that the traditional measure mean latency does not  EOL the behavior of latency ? is described  EOL ? experiments using # paid undergraduates demonstrated how recognition accuracy and latency ? with independent variables such as study and test position rate of presentation and list ?  EOL data were used to develop and test the empirical model  EOL the ? ? with functional ? derived from the experimental data were also used to test several theories of recognition memory  EOL the theories examined all show problems in light of these ? tests and general properties required by a model to account for the data are suggested  EOL as well as ? for ? ? of rt data this paper presents a ? range of phenomena that any theory of recognition memory must explain  EOL
