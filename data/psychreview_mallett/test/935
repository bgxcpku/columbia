discusses the logic of masking experiments and other experiments ? a similar temporal paradigm  EOL contrary to the ? theoretical assumptions it is suggested that # ? of neurons could be responding at ? in some cases to the # stimuli presented in such experiments  EOL the # of these consists of neurons ? by the target and the # consists of neurons ? by the ? or other ?  EOL neurons of the # class ? ? if at all to either of these stimuli ? but are ? by their combined presentation at appropriate temporal ?  EOL the ? for thinking with this additional degree of ? are ? with visual lateral masking  EOL some specific points considered are the effects the postulated # class of neurons could have on the temporal properties of metacontrast the possible role of these neurons in ? a ? metacontrast and a ? paracontrast and the relation they could have to the well known ? between ? movement and masking  EOL it is suggested that some ? of the # class could be involved in the ? of motion  EOL ? ? to a broad range of ? including some ? high ones could be involved in ? ? and visual masking # p ref  EOL
