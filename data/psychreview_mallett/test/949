? of the literature indicates that according to theories of ? attention learning about a stimulus depends on ? to that stimulus this is represented in # stage models by ? that ss ? in ? as well as learning stimulus response ?  EOL it is argued that this assumption however is equally well represented in a formal model by the ? of a stimulus specific learning rate parameter a into the equations describing changes in the associative strength of stimuli  EOL previous theories of ? attention have also assumed that a ss learn to ? to and ? relevant and ? stimuli i.e that a may ? or ? depending on the ? of a stimulus with reinforcement and b there is an inverse relationship between the probabilities of ? to different stimuli i.e that an ? in a to one stimulus is ? by a ? in a to ?  EOL the first assumption has been used to explain the phenomena of ? ? and dimensional transfer the second to explain those of ? and ?  EOL it is argued that although the first assumption is ? by the data the second is not ? and ? are better explained by the choice of an appropriate rule for ? a such that a ? to stimuli that signal no change from the probability of reinforcement predicted by other stimuli  EOL
