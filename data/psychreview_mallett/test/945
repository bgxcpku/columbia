presents a new ? theory of memory traces in which the memory trace is a conceptualized as a ? of trace elements and b defined in terms of the relation between the conditions and the product of retrieval  EOL the properties of a trace thus defined are ? described by ? the ? common and ? ? of # or more retrieval cues  EOL these ? are ? by ? ? the target event with each of the cues  EOL the data ? by the successive ? are then used to ? the ? or structure of the trace by means of the ? method  EOL the logic of this method and ? the general theory is ? to a large variety of to be ? material  EOL a ? experiment with # undergraduates ? that the structure of the traces of to be ? word events was ? to the conditions of initial encoding and that ? of these events under conditions of output ? was represented by a distinctive change in the pattern of trace elements  EOL some potential ? of the theory are considered  EOL
