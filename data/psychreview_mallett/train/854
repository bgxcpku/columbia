states that attention has recently been ? to a systematic relation over experiments between the extent to which items that can be recalled can also be recognized and the overall level of recognition  EOL a model ? both direct access and generation recognition mechanisms in recall is shown to provide a ? account of the phenomenon and to make # novel predictions  EOL the # prediction is that values of the ? ? constant c and values of the probability of recall p rc should be ? related the # is that their product ? rc should be positively related to the degree of ? between cue and target items  EOL data from a large number of experiments are shown to confirm these predictions  EOL
