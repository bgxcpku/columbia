data in operant conditioning and psychophysics are often well fitted by functions of the form y ? super s  EOL a simple theory derives these power functions from the simultaneous equations ? x a sub # f z dz and ? y a sub # f z dz where z is a comparison variable that is ? for the effects of x and y and a sub # and a sub # are sensitivity parameters  EOL in operant conditioning x and y are identified with response rates in psychophysics with measures of stimulus and response  EOL the theory can explain ? sets of power functions ? the dimensional problems with the standard power function and can account for the relation between type i and type ii psychophysical scales  EOL
