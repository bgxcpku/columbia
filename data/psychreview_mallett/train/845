presents a general theory of how children learn conservation concepts  EOL the theory unlike previous content specific ones assumes that there are several ? equivalent ? whereby a conservation concept can be ?  EOL the acquisition process is described at an abstract level in terms of a rule sampling system  EOL this description implies a # state markov model with ? parameters  EOL three experiments designed to test the model quantitative predictions about conservation learning experiments are reported  EOL data generated by the ? ss in these experiments are used both to assess goodness of fit and to test several hypotheses about parameter invariance  EOL the theory provides ? and testable explanations of some empirical phenomena that have ? been of interest to conservation learning researchers  EOL three specific phenomena age changes in ? to conservation training stage effects in learning and transfer of training are ?  EOL likelihood ratio procedures are developed for testing the theory predictions in these # areas  EOL
