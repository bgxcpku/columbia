examines the possibility that the components of an information processing system all operate ? ? information from one to the ? as it becomes available  EOL a model called the cascade model is presented and shown to be compatible with the general form of the relation between time and accuracy in speed accuracy trade off experiments  EOL in the model experimental manipulations may have either or both of # effects on a processing level they may alter the rate of response or the asymptotic quality of the output  EOL the effects of such manipulations on the output of a system of processes is described  EOL the model is then used to ? the subtraction and additive factors methods for analyzing the ? of systems of processes  EOL results include the finding that factors that affect the rates of # different processes would be expected to have additive effects on reaction times under the cascade model whereas # factors that both affect the rate of the same process would tend to interact just as in the case in which the manipulations affect the ? of discrete stages  EOL factors that affect asymptotic output however tend to interact whether they affect the same or different processes  EOL a new method is presented for analyzing processes in cascade which ? the additive factors method to an analysis of the parameters of the function relating response time and accuracy  EOL
