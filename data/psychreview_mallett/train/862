notes that in a recent article a  EOL tversky ? the application of geometric models to similarity data and proposed an alternative set theoretic approach  EOL he suggested that geometric models are inappropriate because the similarity data may ? the metric assumptions underlying such models  EOL in addition he demonstrated that the stimulus context and the nature of the experimental task can affect the similarity relations  EOL it is suggested that a geometric approach may be compatible with these effects if the traditional multidimensional scaling model is ? by the assumption that spatial density in the configuration has an effect on the similarity measure  EOL a distance density model is ? that assumes that similarity is a function of both ? distance and the spatial density of other stimulus points in the ? ? of the metric space  EOL the proposed relationship between similarity and spatial density is supported by empirical evidence  EOL the distance density model is shown to be able to account for violations of the metric ? and certain context and task effects  EOL other issues are discussed with respect to geometric and set theoretic models of similarity # p ref  EOL
