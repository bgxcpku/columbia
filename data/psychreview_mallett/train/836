gives # hypotheses for backward masking by a stimulus suffix of auditory information about the end of an ? memory list  EOL masking by ? ? integration ? and attentional ? ? of a readout process was rejected by evidence that a multiple suffixes produce a smaller masking effect than single suffixes b a suffix that occurs simultaneously with the last memory item on the list has a smaller effect than one that is delayed by a few ? ? and c the ? of the suffix effect depends on its delay independent of the rate at which the list was presented  EOL these ? of evidence are consistent with a masking model based on the operation of lateral inhibition among memory representations of auditory sensory events that are ? by time of ? and by sensory channel characteristics  EOL a functional model for the suffix effect was ? from # factors ? to depend on the delay between a memory list and a suffix a integration at short list suffix delays b backward masking through lateral inhibition at longer delays and c readout of target stimulus information at delays of as long as a second or more  EOL
