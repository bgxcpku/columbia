? whether the presence of noise elements in a visual display would affect the detection of target letters at the perceptual or feature ? level of processing as well as at the decision level  EOL more specifically the experiment assessed whether a input or processing channels operate in an independent or interactive fashion and b how the spatial relation between signal and noise items affects detection performance  EOL in order to distinguish among current theories proposed to account for the ? of noise items on visual processing a forced choice detection task was ? to ? a ? procedure which ? the independent variation of signal noise similarity ? and ?  EOL results of the experiment conducted with # paid ? ? provide evidence for feature specific inhibition at the perceptual level  EOL a theory is proposed that assumes hierarchically organized limited capacity feature detectors and feature specific ? channels  EOL
