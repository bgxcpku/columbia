describes a theory of temporal control which ? responding of animal ss at ? under a variety of learning procedures  EOL ss are viewed as making estimates of the time to reinforcement delivery using a scalar timing process which ? estimates for different values of the interval being ?  EOL scalar timing implies a constant ? of variation  EOL expectancies of reward based on these estimates are formed and a discrimination between response alternatives is made by taking a ratio of their expectancies  EOL in ? schedules of reinforcement the discrimination is between local and overall expectancy of reward  EOL in psychophysical studies of duration discrimination the expectancy ratio reduces the likelihood ratio and in conjunction with the scalar ? results in a general form of weber law  EOL the ? choice function describing preference for different ? and delays of reinforcement also results in a form of weber law  EOL
