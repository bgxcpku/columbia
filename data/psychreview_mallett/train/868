notes that the results of a number of experiments ? to a particular paradigm have ? a highly systematic relation between the probability that recallable words are not ? recognized and the probability of recognition of all words  EOL this recognition failure relation is largely invariant with many conditions that ? affect both recognition and cued recall  EOL the present article proposes an explanation of this ? invariance  EOL the explanation is ? in a mathematical model whose critical assumption is that of retrieval independence informational features of retrieval cues in recognition are ? with those in cued recall  EOL large variations in the values of the model # parameters produce large variations in recognition and cued recall but as long as retrieval independence holds they do not affect the invariance of the recognition failure relation  EOL therefore it is suggested that the phenomenon of recognition failure of recallable words and its largely invariant relation with recognition ? rate are ? of retrieval independence in recognition and cued recall  EOL
