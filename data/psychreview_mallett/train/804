presents a probabilistic choice model called preference tree or pretree that describes choice as a ? hierarchical elimination process  EOL each alternative is represented as a ? ? of aspects and the entire ? of aspects is assumed to have a tree structure  EOL at each stage one ? an aspect i.e a branch of the tree with a probability that is ? to its measure and ? all alternatives not ? to the selected branch  EOL the process ? until a single alternative remains  EOL pretree is considerably more parsimonious than the more general model of elimination by aspects and at the same time it is much less restrictive than models that assume that the strength of preference of one alternative over another is independent of other alternatives  EOL an additional interpretation of pretree as an aggregate model is developed and necessary and ? conditions for the existence of tree representations for binary choice probabilities are ?  EOL pretree fits several sets of individual and aggregate choice probabilities and explains the ? violations of the constant ratio rule  EOL
