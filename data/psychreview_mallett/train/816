the process of vicarious functioning by which equivalent judgments can result from different patterns of cues is central to any theory of judgment  EOL it is argued that both linear ? and process tracing models capture the various aspects of vicarious functioning the ? by dealing with the ? that the organism faces with regard to the ? and trade ? between cues in a ? environment and the latter by dealing with cue search and attention  EOL furthermore although the ? structures and levels of detail of the # models are different it is shown that process tracing protocols can be generated via a general additive rule  EOL therefore both types of models can be ? the same underlying process although at different levels of generality  EOL two experiments in which both models are ? and tested on the same data are presented  EOL in exp i experienced mmpi ? made diagnostic judgments of the degree of ? ? from mmpi ? in exp ii # s ? the ? quality of ? ?  EOL results are discussed with respect to a links between judgment choice and task structure b rule generality and awareness and c advantages of a ? approach  EOL
