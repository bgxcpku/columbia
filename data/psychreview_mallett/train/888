questions the metric and dimensional assumptions that ? the geometric representation of similarity on both theoretical and empirical grounds  EOL a new set theoretical approach to similarity is developed in which objects are represented as ? of features and similarity is described as a feature matching process  EOL specifically a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features  EOL several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli  EOL the model is used to ? analyze and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features the relations between judgments of similarity and difference the presence of asymmetric ? and the effects of context on judgments of similarity  EOL the contrast model ? standard representations of similarity data in terms of ? and ?  EOL it is also used to analyze the relations of ? and ? ?  EOL
