to account both for properties of auditory functioning and for the perceptual ? of various kinds of psychophysical judgments of loudness the present theory holds that the auditory system processes information about the intensity of sounds in a hierarchy of stages  EOL each stage is characterized by a function that ? input components into output components  EOL associated with each stage in processing is a rule for ? the output components of that stage  EOL in the initial peripheral sensory stages these rules are ones of summation accounting thereby for energy summation within critical ? loudness summation across ? ? frequencies and ? loudness summation  EOL underlying loudness summation is a scale approximating the ? scale  EOL in a more central cognitive stage the rule is one of subtraction between components accounting thereby for the perceptual relationship that forms the basis for judgments of loudness differences  EOL underlying loudness difference is a scale approximating the ? scale  EOL thus the theory ? a single hierarchical scheme to account both for certain auditory processes and for ? ? psychological scales of loudness  EOL
