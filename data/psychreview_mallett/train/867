most theories dealing with ill defined concepts assume that performance is based on category level information or a ? of category level and specific item information  EOL a context theory of ? is described in which judgments are assumed to derive ? from stored ? information  EOL the main idea is that a probe item ? as a retrieval cue to access information associated with stimuli similar to the probe  EOL the predictions of the context theory are contrasted with those of a class of theories including prototype theory that assume that the information ? into judgments can be derived from an additive combination of information from component cue dimensions  EOL across # experiments with # paid ss using both geometric forms and schematic faces as stimuli the context theory consistently gave a better account of the data  EOL the relation of context theory to other theories and phenomena associated with ill defined concepts is discussed in detail  EOL
