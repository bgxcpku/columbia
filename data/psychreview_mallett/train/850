animals match relative response rate to relative reinforcement rate in # choice situations where each alternative provides reinforcement according to a vi schedule  EOL it is shown that matching and a model proposed for it by r  EOL j  EOL ? # can both be derived from reinforcement maximization under a linear response constraint  EOL empirical results are consistent with the constraint assumption but they fail to support an ? of the approach to choice situations in which one alternative ? reinforcement according to a ratio schedule  EOL ? matching ? ? may be a fundamental principle  EOL
