discusses a theory of the perceptual identification of complex stimuli that is based on the assumptions that word images are ? in an acoustic space and responses are selected by forced choice from a restricted set of word images defined by the stimulus  EOL applied to the recognition of words in noise the theory provides a quantitative account of the ? in which correct and erroneous responses of different frequencies will occur  EOL the theory is tested by deriving predictions by assessing goodness of fit and by estimating parameters and comparing the values obtained with theoretical expectations  EOL these tests appear to support the theory  EOL
