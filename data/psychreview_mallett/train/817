theoretical accounts of the speed accuracy trade off in rapid movement have usually ? on within movement error detection and ? and have consistently ? the possibility that motor output variability might be ? related to movement amplitude and movement time  EOL the present author proposes a theory of motor output variability that accounts for the relationship among the movement amplitude movement time the mass to be ? and the resulting movement error  EOL predictions are derived from physical principles empirical evidence supporting the principles is presented for # movement paradigms single ? responses reciprocal movements and rapid timing tasks and the theory and data are discussed in terms of past theoretical accounts and ? research ?
