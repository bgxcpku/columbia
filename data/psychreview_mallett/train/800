the behaving organism and its environment constitute interacting elements of a feedback system  EOL ? with a kinetic model of the effects of reinforcement on preference and ? feedback functions describing the effects of responding on reinforcement rate a systems analysis of concurrent reinforcement schedule situations was developed  EOL correct predictions were generated of both the form of the acquisition of preference and of asymptotic preference levels for choice between probabilistic reinforcement schedules i.e  EOL vi and ?  EOL a kinetic model was then formulated at the level of switching behavior  EOL all predictions at the molar preference level followed also from this molecular analysis  EOL in addition the switching model correctly predicted a constant ? of transition probabilities local switching rates and a ? in overall switching rate as both preference strength and the difference between reinforcement rates ?  EOL the present systems analysis is seen as being unique among recent theoretical ? concerned with schedules of reinforcement in its ability to describe molecular as well as molar properties of both transition state and ? state behavior  EOL
