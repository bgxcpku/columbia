weight parameters in information integration theory represent viable theoretical constructs  EOL ? empirical estimates of weights are ? in some models when the stimulus sets are ? from a complete ? ? of the levels of different types of information  EOL this paper ? a methodological change in the task both stimulus factors and their levels are varied  EOL this ? in conjunction with a theoretical model that incorporates the differential effect of each factor of information allows for a solution of weights and scale values  EOL
