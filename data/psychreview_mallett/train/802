reviews recent experimental work on imagery identifying specific levels of information processing within the visual system at which mental images and physical objects and events are functionally equivalent as revealed by their perceptual and behavioral effects  EOL findings demonstrate that these functional ? can ? even to levels of the visual system where the effects produced cannot be explained by what people might ? about objects and events or by how they ? to perform  EOL effects produced when images are formed are often smaller than corresponding effects produced when objects and events are observed and ? imagers often show ? effects when forming images than ? imagers  EOL on the basis of these findings it is argued that mental imagery can result in the activation of information processing mechanisms at many levels of the visual system even those mechanisms whose operating characteristics are not influenced by how objects and events might be conceptualized  EOL
