discusses a class of discrete state probabilistic models that ? for the ? ? of the effects of both self ? processes including ? and interactive processes on the ? reciprocal and ? ? of observable responses  EOL in most of these models the # responses made at time t # by ? of an interacting ? are ? independent given the pair of responses made at time t  EOL for each model ? parameters are defined in terms of state transition probabilities and are labeled for the most part as measures of ? or of sensitivity to previous own and other behavior  EOL the models are applied to data ? by other researchers on the self ? nature of social ? on ? in a natural setting and on parent ? interactions and the resulting parameter estimates are discussed  EOL possible applications of the models for assessing the effects of small group interaction are also ?
