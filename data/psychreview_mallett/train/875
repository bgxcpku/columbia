models proposed for probability learning largely represent performance rather than learning theory  EOL ? for this ? quite different models have been required to provide accounts of data ? from different experimental paradigms  EOL in the present approach a common theoretical framework is sought in concepts of coding and organization in memory  EOL following the theoretical analysis an observation transfer paradigm is developed that ? the study of predictive behavior depending on categorical as distinguished from episodic memory  EOL the paradigm was tested in # experiments with # ss exp i assessed the effects of variation in both stimulus frequency and outcome probability exp ii examined the role of stimulus ? and exp iii attempted to ? the encoding of trial outcomes in memory  EOL results suggest that probability learning and transfer derive from frequency learning  EOL the individual ? events and forms representations in memory of relative frequencies of event categories  EOL when different cues in a multiple cue probability learning situation occur equally often this process yields predictive behavior closely ? the probabilities that alternative events associated with a cue will occur when the cue is present  EOL but when cue frequencies are ? the categorical memory model implies that predictive behavior may be ? out of line with ? probabilities  EOL in general depending on task requirements predictive responses are either direct ? of relative frequency judgments or are governed by strategies involving an additional level of encoding of event categories  EOL
