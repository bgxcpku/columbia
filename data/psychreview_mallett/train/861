s  EOL ? claims that r  EOL ? multiple observations model for signal detection can be ? as ? ? to a latency function whereby the latency of response ? with distance of the median position of the observations from the criterion point  EOL it is demonstrated that while this claim is correct the form of the latency function generated by the model is different in important ? from that usually described by the more general latency function hypothesis in particular it is a dual ? function and this difference in form is important in terms of predictions of the multiple observations model as compared with predictions to be made of the general latency function hypothesis  EOL the form of the function is derived by means of a consideration of order ? and is shown to be quite general  EOL the possibility of ? the mean of the ? of observations as ? a latency function is discussed and the relationship between the mean or median to confidence judgments is considered  EOL
