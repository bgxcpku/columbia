proposes the knowledge ? theory to explain the acquisition representation and processing of knowledge  EOL the theory assumes that both the representation and processing of knowledge change qualitatively as learning progresses  EOL learning ? with the development and ? of representations of lower order components of a knowledge structure each of which is activated in an all or none fashion  EOL the component representations are ? ? by ? that are also strengthened as learning progresses  EOL a configuration of associated component representations may be strengthened to the point of ?  EOL then it is functionally a single ? in memory and is activated in an all or none fashion as its ? previously were  EOL lower order memory representations are assumed to be ? organized and unitized as higher order memory representations  EOL ? an entire knowledge structure may have a single unitized all or none ? memory representation  EOL three experiments were conducted using # high ? and # college students to demonstrate the predicted phenomenon ?  EOL as well the theory is shown to be consistent with a large body of experimental results  EOL
