reviews a previously proposed model for memory based on neurophysiological considerations  EOL it is assumed that a nervous system activity is ? represented as the set of simultaneous individual neuron activities in a group of neurons b different memory traces make use of the same synapses and c synapses ? two patterns of neural activity by ? synaptic ? ? to the product of ? and ? activity forming a ? of synaptic ?  EOL this model is extended by a ? positive feedback of a set of neurons ? itself and b allowing the individual neurons to ?  EOL a hybrid model partly analog and partly binary ?
