presents a behavioral theory based on physiological data in which the positioning and timing of limb movement are accounted for by slowly adapting joint receptors  EOL the position of a limb is known by which joint receptors are firing and the timing of limb movement is based on the time varying features of the receptor firing function  EOL ? some of which are ? supported in the literature are made about static timing the interval between successive responses dynamic timing ? of movement one limb timing another reaction time phenomena effects of tension on the limb effects of ? generalization and learning and memory  EOL alternative ? of positioning and timing are discussed  EOL
