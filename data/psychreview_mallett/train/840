for the ? and representation of structures in similarity data an alternative to the ? continuous spatial models of multidimensional scaling and factor analysis and to the ? hierarchical models of discrete clustering is presented  EOL it is assumed that the ? similarity of any # objects is a simple additive function of underlying weights associated with whatever properties are shared by both objects  EOL based on this model a method of additive clustering ? is described that is capable of estimating a which ? of a given set of objects correspond to positively ? properties and b the numerical values of those weights  EOL the method ? hierarchical clustering as a special case and can be ? as a discrete analog of principal components analysis  EOL applications to several diverse types of data are presented and the ? of the results on current theoretical issues concerning distinctive features and the adequacy of ? hierarchical models is discussed # p ref  EOL
