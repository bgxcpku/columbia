theories of decision making are reviewed particularly those that ? light on clinical decision making  EOL two approaches are examined in detail traditional prescriptive theories derived from probability theory and theories based on nonprobabilistic inference processes with a ? memory mechanism  EOL an experiment using a laboratory analog of clinical ? with # ? students ? data about several aspects of the decision process including information seeking and the terminal decision  EOL a # task ? with the diagnostic task was designed to provide some ? into the ss organization of the diagnostic task material in memory using the proposition ? ? method  EOL systematic effects of task structure on the ? of knowledge about the task were obtained  EOL in # computer ? the traditional prescriptive approach to decision making gave a moderately good account of the behavior observed in the diagnostic task but the cognitive theory based on nonprobabilistic inference rules interacting with simple recall processes gave equal or better quantitative predictions  EOL it is concluded that the nonprobabilistic approach holds ? promise for the description of complex decision processes  EOL
