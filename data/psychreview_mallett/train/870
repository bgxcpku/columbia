a model for the identification of speech sounds is proposed that assumes that a the acoustic cues are perceived independently b the feature evaluation provides information about the degree to which each quality is present in the speech sound c each speech sound is defined by a propositional prototype in long term memory that ? how the featural information is ? and d the speech sound is identified on the basis of the relative degree to which it matches the various alternative ?  EOL the model was supported by the results of an experiment in which ss identified ? consonant vowel ? that were ? generated by independently varying acoustic cues for ? and for ? of ?  EOL this experiment using # college ? ss also ? previous findings of changes in the identification boundary of one acoustic dimension as a function of the level of another dimension  EOL these results have previously been interpreted as evidence for the interaction of the ? of the acoustic features themselves  EOL in contrast the present model provides a good description of the data including these boundary changes while still maintaining complete ? at the feature evaluation stage of processing  EOL
