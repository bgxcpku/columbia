a # process theory of human information processing is proposed and applied to detection search and attention phenomena  EOL automatic processing is activation of a learned sequence of elements in long term memory that is initiated by appropriate ? and then ? automatically without s control without ? the capacity limitations of the system and without necessarily ? attention  EOL controlled processing is a ? activation of a sequence of elements that can be set ? ? and easily but requires attention is capacity limited usually serial in nature and is controlled by the s  EOL a series of studies with ? # ss using both reaction time and accuracy measures is presented which traces these concepts in the form of automatic detection and controlled search through the areas of detection search and attention  EOL results in these areas are shown to arise from common mechanisms  EOL automatic detection is shown to develop following consistent mapping of stimuli to responses over ?  EOL controlled search was utilized in varied mapping paradigms and in the present studies it ? the form of serial terminating search  EOL
