reviews the visual masking literature in the context of known neurophysiological and psychophysical properties of the visual system ? response  EOL the literature indicates that # consistent and ? pattern masking effects a type b forward or paracontrast b type b backward or metacontrast and c type a forward and backward can be explained in terms of # simple sensory processes  EOL it is hypothesized that sustained channels are involved in the processing of structural or ? information whereas transient channels are involved in ? the spatial location or change in spatial location i.e the motion of a stimulus  EOL in the proposed model type b forward masking or paracontrast is mediated via lateral inhibition ? in the ? ? ? of the ? ? of the sustained cells  EOL in ? to this mechanism of ? inhibition type b backward masking or metacontrast is produced by a mechanism of ? inhibition i.e transient cells ? ? the activity of sustained cells  EOL both mechanisms are assumed to be operating at or prior to the contour forming levels of visual processing  EOL type a masking effects are explained in terms of sensory integration of sustained channel information at ? and iconic levels of visual processing  EOL the implications of this ? model for ? ? and information processing approaches to pattern recognition are discussed # p ref  EOL
