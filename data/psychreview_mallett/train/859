when # patterns are compared same s judgments typically are ? than different d judgments  EOL this result is ? because s but not d judgments would seem to require ? and exhaustive processing  EOL some models have ? s processing as more efficient or ? than d processing due to an identity ? or to priming  EOL when accuracy rather than reaction time rt is examined however s processing ? generally less efficient than d processing  EOL ss are more likely to make false d responses to s pairs than false s responses to d pairs  EOL the present ? operator theory holds that internal noise is more likely to produce spurious featural ? than matches and that the ? ? to ? these spurious differences produces the typically longer rt for d judgments  EOL data from comparisons of single pattern or ? ? were fitted to a single ? ? model based on the theory # # p ref  EOL
