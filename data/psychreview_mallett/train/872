develops a theory of memory retrieval and shows that it ? over a range of experimental paradigms  EOL access to memory traces is viewed in terms of a resonance metaphor  EOL the probe item evokes the search set on the basis of probe memory item ? just as a ? tuning ? evokes ? ? in other tuning ?  EOL evidence is ? in parallel from each probe memory item comparison and each comparison is ? by a continuous random ? process  EOL in item recognition the decision process is self terminating on matching comparisons and exhaustive on ? comparisons  EOL the mathematical model produces predictions about accuracy mean reaction time error latency and reaction time ? that are in good ? with data from # experiments conducted with # undergraduates  EOL the theory is applied to # item recognition paradigms sternberg ? list study test and continuous and to speed accuracy paradigms results are found to provide a basis for comparison of these paradigms  EOL it is ? that neural ? models can be ? to the retrieval theory with little difficulty and that semantic memory models may ? from such a retrieval scheme  EOL
