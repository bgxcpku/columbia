EOL the ? are predictable only when the control schema can be made explicit  EOL on the production ? the model is concerned with the generation of recall and ? protocols  EOL this process is partly ? and partly ? involving the inverse operation of the macro operators  EOL the model is applied to a ? from a psychological research report and methods for the empirical testing of the model are developed  EOL
