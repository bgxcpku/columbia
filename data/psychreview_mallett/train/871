presents some new results relating simple detection and recognition of m potential signals  EOL these ? are based on the assumption that signals are equally ? and ?  EOL the detection of # of m potential signals is also discussed  EOL it is shown that the ? decision rule for the ? case and a simple rule based on independent threshold detectors predict ? identical behavior  EOL the change in detectability as a function of m depends strongly on the initial detectability level  EOL finally a discrete model binary model is contrasted with a continuous model  EOL the predicted relation between simple detection and recognition is derived for # ? of the discrete model and compared to the predictions derived for the continuous model  EOL
