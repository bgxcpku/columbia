hybrid theory of classical conditioning is extended to encompass ? schedules of reinforcement in operant conditioning  EOL the basic assumption familiar in other incentive type theories is that the expectation of reward becomes conditioned to response produced feedback stimuli from the operant response  EOL the resulting excitatory potential changes dynamically in relation to the stimulus memory trace of the ? reinforcer the trace being conceptualized in terms of molecular elements with different ?  EOL finally excitatory potential is ? into ? probability of response ? on the basis of a ? variable threshold the mean of which also changes dynamically with the ? properties of response produced feedback stimulus memory traces  EOL the theory implies a cyclical transition between # basic but related states one corresponding to the ? ? in responding and the other corresponding to the ? response rate  EOL this theoretical analysis fits well with the empirical data presented  EOL
