reports a series of # experiments that present evidence that color information is available ? the course of iconic memory  EOL ? i and ii with # college age ss each measured iconic delay curves for ? color ? and for reading letters whose ? are ? through ? differences in the manner of a color ? test  EOL results show that iconic memory for letters defined by ? ? color differences ? about as long as iconic memory for ? letters on ? ?  EOL exp iii # ss attempted to show a type of ? color word ? in iconic memory in which ss ability to ? out ? information was ? for the entire duration of iconic memory by ? and iconically stored color information  EOL results of the # experiments indicate that a rods cannot be the ? ? of iconic ? and b the argument that iconic memory is ? ? cannot ? on the ? that iconic memory is ? by the rods  EOL it is argued that the available evidence from the literature indicates that rods are unlikely to be involved in iconic memory at ? light levels  EOL experimental operations are suggested that might establish the extent to which iconic memory is central or peripheral  EOL
