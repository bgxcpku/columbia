{\bf Observations and Musings}

\begin{itemize}
\item Given a fixed size model, doing posterior inference with fewer observations usually mixes faster.
\item Constancy is a strong feature of the world
\item Percepts degrade slowly in the presence of occlusion (can view a scene through a occluding filter (or hear through a bandpass fliter))
\item Slowness and continuity is a feature of the world
\item The hardware is, largely speaking, fixed.
\item The world is approximately Markov at all scales
\item The world is largely deterministic.
\end{itemize}
